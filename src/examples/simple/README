Instructions
============

Requirements
------------

Follow the instructions at the top level doc/ directory for installing and
setting up a broker and txAMQP.

Running
-------

1. Open two consoles:
   a) In one of them run the txconsumer.py script:
      $ python txconsumer.py host port vhost username password path_to_spec
      e.g. txconsumer.py localhost 5672 / guest guest ../../specs/standard/amqp0-8.stripped.xml
   b) In the other one run the txpublisher.py script:
      $ python txpublisher.py host port vhost username password path_to_spec content [count]
      e.g. txpublisher.py localhost 5672 / guest guest ../../specs/standard/amqp0-8.stripped.xml hello 1000

Where:
- host: The host where the AMQP broker is located.
- port: The port where the AMQP broker listens on.
- vhost: The virtual host (depending on your broker configuration, default
    in most cases is '/').
- username: The username to log in to the broker (default in most cases
    is 'guest').
- password: The username to log in to the broker (default in most cases
    is 'guest').
- path_to_spec: The path to the AMQP spec that you want to use. Keep in mind
    that depending on the broker you use, you will need a different spec:
    - RabbitMQ 1.5.3: $TXAMQP_PATH/src/specs/rabbitmq/amqp0-8.stripped.xml
    - OpenAMQ 1.3c5: $TXAMQP_PATH/src/specs/standard/amqp0-9.xml
    - Qpid M3 (Java): $TXAMQP_PATH/src/specs/qpid/amqp.0-8.xml

2. You should see messages being sent from the second console and received
   in the first one.
